// What will the following two lines of code output?

console.log(0.3 + 0.6);
console.log(0.3 + 0.6 === 0.9);

/*
 We would expect this to output 0.9 and then `true`. However, these values
 are examples of some of the unexpected results that can be had when using
 floating point numbers for numeric operations.

 This actually outputs 0.8999999999999999 and `false`.
